## About me

I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Chair of Computer Systems](https://dse.in.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My research interests lie in the field of software systems for quantum computing with a particular focus on building software abstractions to scale Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era computing, such as quantum resource management and distributed quantum computing.

More specifically, I design and build systems that increase the scalability of real-world quantum applications and the resource efficiency of the underlying NISQ resources, i.e., utilization and load balance. Previously I had been working in the distributed systems area, specifically in distributed shared logs and replication protocols.

Before joining TUM, I graduated from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), [University of Crete](https://en.uoc.gr/), Greece, where I worked on highly parallel data structures and cloud scheduling. 

Please call me Manos. Emmanouil sounds awkwardly official.

## Hobbies & Interests
When I'm not immersed in the quantum realm, I'm diving deep into the world of cinema. As every [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/manosgior/) user should do, I analyze films with the precision of a quantum algorithm, dissecting every frame, narrative twist, and camera angle—because why watch one film when you can watch ten on a weekend? My love for storytelling extends beyond the screen into photography, capturing landscapes, nature, and architecture. Outside, I swap my love for cinematic journeys for real ones, like hiking (I'm proud of my recent achievement of hiking the Andes, 2000-5000 meters in height). I also keep active by swimming, lifting weights in the gym, and running.
