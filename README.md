## About me

I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Systems Research Group](https://dse.in.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My research interests lie in the field of systems software for quantum computing, i.e., I bring systems abstractions and mechanisms into quantum computing for improved programmability, performance, and scalability. 

In particular, I focus on compiler and OS mechanisms that address the low fidelity, heterogeneity, under-utilization, and significant queuing times of quantum resources. To achieve this, I design systems that leverage quantum error mitigation, circuit cutting and knitting, multi-programming, and hybrid quantum-classical resource estimation and scheduling.

Previously, I worked in the distributed systems area, specifically in distributed shared logs, hardware-assisted replication protocols, and the implementation of fast reads in asynchronous replication protocols.

Before joining TUM, I graduated from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), [University of Crete](https://en.uoc.gr/), Greece, where I worked on highly parallel data structures and cloud scheduling. 

Please call me Manos. Emmanouil sounds awkwardly official.

## Hobbies & Interests
I *really* love cinema (I have watched more than 800 films), so follow me on Letterboxd if you have an account ;) [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/manosgior/). I also like photography, focusing on landscapes, nature, and architecture. Despite being a computer scientist, I am pretty active: I enjoy hiking (I'm proud of my recent achievement of hiking the Andes, a 4000->5000 meters altitude hike), swimming, lifting weights in the gym, and running.
