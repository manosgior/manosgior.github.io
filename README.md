## About me

I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Chair of Computer Systems](https://dse.in.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My research interests lie in the field of systems software for quantum computing, i.e., I bring systems abstractions and mechanisms into quantum computing for improved programmability, performance, and scalability. 

In particular, I focus on compiler and OS mechanisms that address the low fidelity, vast heterogeneity, and underutilization of quantum devices and the users' experience with respect to job queuing times. To achieve this, I design systems that leverage *circuit cutting and knitting*, spatiotemporal multiplexing (aka scheduling), and hybrid quantum-classical resource estimation and management.

Previously, I worked in the distributed systems area, specifically in distributed shared logs, state machine replication (SMR), and replication protocols.

Before joining TUM, I graduated from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), [University of Crete](https://en.uoc.gr/), Greece, where I worked on highly parallel data structures and cloud scheduling. 

Please call me Manos. Emmanouil sounds awkwardly official.

## Hobbies & Interests
When I'm not immersed in the quantum realm, I'm diving deep into the world of cinema. With more than 800 films watched, I am a self-proclaimed [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/manosgior/) critic. My love for storytelling extends beyond the screen into photography, capturing landscapes, nature, and architecture. Outside, I swap my love for cinematic journeys for real ones, like hiking (I'm proud of my recent achievement of hiking the Andes, 2000-5000 meters in height). I also keep active by swimming, lifting weights in the gym, and running.
