# About me

I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Chair of Computer Systems](https://dse.in.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My research interests lie in the field of software systems for quantum computing with a particular focus on building software abstractions to scale Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era computing, such as quantum resource management and distributed quantum computing.

More specifically, I design and build systems that increase the scalability of real-world quantum applications and the resource efficiency of the underlying NISQ resources, i.e., utilization and load balance. Previously I had been working in the distributed systems area, specifically in distributed shared logs and replication protocols.

Before joining TUM, I graduated from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), [University of Crete](https://en.uoc.gr/), Greece, where I worked on highly parallel data structures and cloud scheduling. 

Please call me Manos. Emmanouil sounds awkwardly official.
